# go-to-lunch
Go program to determine lunch groups

The general idea for the program is that it will read in a list of 
lunch attendees, iterate through several thousand randomized groups,
and find a set of groups with the maximum variance.

Potentially, it will also take into account the amount of time that
has passed since any two people had lunch together, and include that
as a factor in calculating the variance.
